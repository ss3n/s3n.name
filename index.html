        <p>
        	Since I do not understand how websites work entirely yet, as a starting point, I have decided to take a course on Coursera called "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" by Yaakov Chaikin of JHU (https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome)
    	</p>
        <p>
        	It is a 5 week course and involves building a restaurant site as a project. Apart from buiilding the restaurant site as an assignment, I have decided to use this as my personal webpage to explore and tweak around with tools I learn from the course as a more hands-on learning process.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Each week of the course corresponds to a separate module of the syllabus, which are:
        	<div>1. Introduction to HTML5</div>
        	<div>2. Introduction to CSS3</div>
        	<div>3. Coding the Static Restaurant Site</div>
        	<div>4. Introduction to Javascript</div>
        	<div>5. Using Javascript to Build Web Applications</div>
        </p>
        <p>
        	As I take the course sequentially, I will be using lessons learnt in each session and apply them to upgrade this website, which I feel would give me maximum benefit out of the lesson structure.
