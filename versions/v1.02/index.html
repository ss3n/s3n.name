      	<h2>Motive</h2>Purpose and description
        <p>
        	Since I do not understand how websites work entirely yet, as a starting point, I have decided to take a course on Coursera called "HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" by Yaakov Chaikin of JHU (https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers/home/welcome).
    		</p>
        <p>
        	It is a 5 week course and involves building a restaurant site as a project. Apart from buiilding the restaurant site as an assignment, I have decided to use this as my personal webpage to explore and tweak around with tools I learn from the course as a more hands-on learning process.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Each week of the course corresponds to a separate module of the syllabus, which are:
        	<ol>
	        	<li>Introduction to HTML5</li>
	        	<li>Introduction to CSS3</li>
	        	<li>Coding the Static Restaurant Site</li>
	        	<li>Introduction to Javascript</li>
	        	<li>Using Javascript to Build Web Applications</li>
        	</ol>
        </p>
        <p>
        	As I take the course sequentially, I will be using lessons learnt in each session and apply them to upgrade this website, which I feel would give me maximum benefit out of the lesson structure.
